# Toolchains
Minimalist avr-gcc toolchains for compiling Optiboot

It's getting tough to find toolchains (compiler, shell utilities, "make", "avrdude") for compiling AVR programs like Optiboot,
without needing to download several gigabytes worth of some vendor IDE, and/or having to go all over the web to find individual tools.

So I've put together some zips containing "known working" versions of those tools.  Github doesn't like large binary zip files,
so I've put them on my google drive.  In generals, these have avr-gcc and avrdude as extracted from the Arduino distributions,
and the windows version has shell utilities and make extracted from "Microchip Studio."
